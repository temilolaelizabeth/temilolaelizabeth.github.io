<p>path of success and grace. i have being an achiever right from my childhood,i gained all this through boldness and encouragement</p>
<p>During my primary school days i became the SOCIAL PREFECT because i had the qualities of a leader. I represented my school at </p>
<p>competitions and it brought great honour to the school. I then graduated witha good grade with a price of one of the best graduating </p>
<p>students in school. My secondary school didn't stop my achievement,i was positioned the SPORT PREFECT that wasnt my calling but i </p>
